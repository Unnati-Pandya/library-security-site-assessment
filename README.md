 ## Library Security Site Assessment — Physical Infrastructure Review

 **Project Owner:** Unnati Pandya
 
Physical security audit and site assessment for a college library. Evaluated layout, access control, surveillance coverage, workstation risks, and delivered actionable security improvements.

## Overview
This project involved on-site rveiew of library's physical infrastructure to analyze how people, devices and space interact.
The objective was to identify risk that could led to an unauthorized acces, data exposure, safety issues or operational disruptions.

## The assessment focused on:

- Entry and exit access paths
- Camera visibility and blind spots
- Staff-only zones and restricted areas
- Workstation placements and privacy
- Storage windows, and physical asset protection


  ## Assessment Highlights

  - Observed unsecured workstations screens near public sitting zones
  - Indetified multiple areas with unauthorized open access
  - Found misaligned surveillance angles creating blind spots
  - Notes unmarked or accessible staff storage areas
  - Documented environmental risks such as open windows and unprotected cable layouts


    ## Recommendations
    
  - Introduce privacy-oriented workstation placement
  - Enforce restricted access to staff rooms and operational spaces
  - Realign Camera angles to eliminate blind spots
  - Implement signage for controlled areas
  - Improve physical storage controls to protect sensitive assets
 

  ## Outcomes

- Reduced unauthorized visibility of workstations
- Strengthened spatial seperation between staff and public area
- Improved visitor flow through library layout
- Increased physical resillience against opportunistic threats
- Actionable roadmap for long-term security compliance
